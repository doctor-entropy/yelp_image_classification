When running this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlibs
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV 2

Project was built using Python 2

The "Yelp" dataset for the first part (Classifying if the image is 'Inside', 'Outside', 'Food', 'Drink' or 'Menu) can be downloaded at this link, this can take a few hours (Make sure you digitally sign to acquire the dataset):
https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

The other dataset downloaded using "FatKun" is present along with the zipfile, under 'drinks' and 'food_photos' folders (This is for classifying the type of food or drink present in the image)

Note:
1. I am unable to provide trained model weights along with the zip file because these files are large, please email me if you need the weights: gauthamv93@yahoo.com
2. Only the chosen CNN model architectures are provided
3. While evaluating the project, first please go through 'capstone_env.ipyn'(which is the first part)  and then to 'capstone_food.ipynb', 'capstone_drinks.ipynb'(which are the second parts)  and lastly to 'yelp_application.ipynb' (which makes full predictions based on the trained weights and models from previous parts)
